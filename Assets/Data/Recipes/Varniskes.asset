    Method

    

    1.
    Start by bringing a pan of water to the boil. This will be for the veg stock.

    2.
    Prepare all of the vegetables.

    3. Add two tablespoons of olive oil to a
    large pan and begin to sweat down the onions, celery and garlic over medium heat
    until soft.

    4. Next add the arborio rice and stir until every grain of
    rice is coated with oil.

    5. Begin to add the vegetable stock one ladle
    at a time, stirring continuously. Once the stock has absorbed into the rice,
    add the next ladle. Repeat until the rice is soft with a slight bite to it (al
    dente).

    6. Add in the sliced leeks followed by the peas and cook for a
    further 3-5 minutes.

    7. Stir in the butter (if using) followed by the grated
    Parmesan. Check the seasoning and alter with sea salt and black pepper if needed.
    Serve to finish with a final grating of parmesan and cracked black pepper.

    

    Enjoy!'
