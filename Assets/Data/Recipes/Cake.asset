  <TimeInMinutes>k__BackingField: 50
  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "It is necessary\r\n\r\n    - cottage cheese - 50 g;\r\n   
    - chicken egg - 4 pcs.;\r\n    - sugar - 150 g;\r\n    - wheat flour - 150 g;\r\n   
    - butter - 50 g;\r\n    - berries - 250 g;\r\n    - baking powder - 8 g;\r\n   
    - vanilla essence - optional.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\nStep 1\r\n\r\nFirst, you
    need to prepare the dough for the curd cake. To do this, combine chicken eggs
    with sugar, then beat with a mixer until you get a fluffy and light mass. Also,
    a small amount of vanilla essence must be added to this mixture.\r\nStep 2\r\n\r\nThen
    add cottage cheese, melted butter to this mass and beat well again.\r\nStep 3\r\n\r\nCombine
    flour with baking powder and sift, then pour a small stream into the curd mass,
    mix the dough with gentle movements. It is best to do this with a spatula, if
    you do it with a mixer, then the cake can turn out to be very dense in structure.\r\nStep
    4\r\n\r\nGrease a bowl of a multicooker with oil and sprinkle with a small amount
    of wheat flour, then put the prepared dough, spread the berries on top. For this
    curd cake, you can use any assortment of berries, for example, strawberries,
    raspberries, strawberries or currants. You can also add nectarine or peach to
    your cupcake, however a large amount of berries and fruits can make your cupcake
    soft.\r\nStep 5\r\n\r\nPlace the bowl with the curd cake in the multicooker,
    turn on the appropriate Baking mode and leave for an hour. After the indicated
    time, check the readiness of your cake. It is best done with a wooden stick,
    which should be dry until the middle of the cake. If necessary, add more time
    and bake the curd cake with berries until tender."
