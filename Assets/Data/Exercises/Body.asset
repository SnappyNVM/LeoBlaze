  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "Step 1\n\r\nLie on your back. Bridge pose, or short
    bridge, is a beginner backbend exercise that\u2019s common in yoga and Pilates.
    It\u2019s not nearly as strenuous as the full gymnastics bridge. It is performed
    on the ground, and the shoulders never leave the floor, so it\u2019s a good move
    for beginners.\r\n\r\n    Bridge pose is good for stretching the spine, neck,
    thighs, and hip flexors.\r\n    This exercise will work best if you're on a cushioned
    but firm surface, such as a carpeted area or an exercise mat on the floor.\r\n\r\nStep
    2 Bend your knees.\r\r\n\r\nBend your knees. While on your back, bend your knees
    to bring your feet in toward your bum. Make sure you keep the soles of your feet
    flat on the ground and your knees shoulder-width apart.\n\r\nStep 3 Extend your
    arms out beside your body.\r\n\r\nExtend your arms out beside your body. Keep
    your palms flat on the ground. If your fingers can't touch your heels, bring
    your feet in closer.\n\r\nStep 4 Lift off the ground.\r\n\r\r\nLift off the ground.
    In bridge pose, your feet, shoulders, arms, and hands stay on the ground. Push
    into the ground equally with these parts to lift the rest of your body off the
    ground. You want your legs, hips, buttocks, and back to come off the ground and
    raise toward the ceiling.\n\r\nStep 5 Lift your chest.\r\n\r\nLift your chest.
    This will help stretch out your back fully. At this point, your knees should
    be bent and your weight evenly distributed between your feet, shoulders, and
    upper arm area.\r\n\r\n    Your neck should be able to move freely, but do not
    turn your head in bridge pose).\r\n    Keep your feet parallel and flat on the
    ground, and keep your thighs aligned and slightly apart.\r\n    Hold bridge pose
    in this way for at least one minute, or go on to one of the variations.\r\n\r\nStep
    6 Bring your hands together under your body.\r\n\r\nBring your hands together
    under your body. This is one minor variation of bridge pose. Because your weight
    is on your shoulders and upper arms, you should be able to bring your palms together
    under your body and clasp your hands together.\r\n\r\n    Keep your arms extended
    and pressed into the mat as you do this. Make sure your palms are touching.\r\n\r\nStep
    7 Try the single-leg variation.\r\n\r\nTry the single-leg variation. Another
    version of bridge pose involves lifting one knee at a time while maintaining
    the pose. With your arms flat on the ground or together under your body, lift
    one foot off the ground and bring your knee in toward your chest.\r\n\r\n   
    Hold this for 30 seconds before putting your foot back on the ground and repeating
    with the other leg.\r\n    Don\u2019t let your hips or buttocks drop toward the
    ground when you're on one foot.\r\n\r\nStep 8 Release from bridge pose.\r\n\r\nRelease
    from bridge pose. Unclasp your hands and place your arms beside your body again,
    palms flat on the ground. Slowly, and with control, lower your chest and back,
    starting at the neck and working your way down your spine until your bottom is
    on the ground again."
