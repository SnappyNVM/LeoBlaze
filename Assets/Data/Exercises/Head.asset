  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "\rStep 1\n\nGo slowly. When massaging the person's
    head, try to go in slow, gentle strokes. Slow strokes generally feel better than
    fast movements. Also, slow movements tend to be much more relaxing than faster
    movements.\r\nFor this type of massage, it's fine for the person to be sitting
    up or lying down.\r\n\r\nStep 2 Work in small circles.\n\r\r\nWork in small circles.
    Using your fingertips, make light circular motions across the person's head.
    Move from back to front and then front to back. You can go over the head a couple
    of times with this motion.\n\r\nStep 3 Massage the neck.\n\r\r\nMassage the neck.
    With one hand, cup the person's neck. Gently rub the neck with the thumb on one
    side and the other fingers on the opposite side. Move up and down the neck. Try
    to move the skin as you massage instead of rubbing on top of the skin.\r\nYou
    can also use this motion at the base of the head where the hair begins.\r\nIf
    you're massaging yourself, use your thumbs at the base of your head. With one
    thumb on each side of your head, use circular motions to massage the base of
    your head. You carry a lot of tension here, so some slow massaging can help.\n\r\nStep
    4 Massage the head with the heels of your palms.\n\r\r\nMassage the head with
    the heels of your palms. Run your hands under the hair near the temples. You
    can use this technique on another person, but it works just as well doing it
    on yourself. The heels of your palms should end up over the temples. Apply light
    pressure, and push upward for a few seconds. You can use this technique all over
    the head.\r\n"
