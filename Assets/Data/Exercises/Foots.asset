    Start at the tip of the toe and move slowly up to their ankle. Move back down
    their foot, starting from their ankle. Apply firm pressure with your thumbs,
    cupping their foot in your hands.\r\n\r\n    Move up and down their foot two
    to three times. Keep their foot close to your chest area, with your body leaning
    towards them. This will help you apply the right amount of pressure to their
    foot.\r\n    Use the strength of your body weight, rather than the muscles in
    your thumbs, to massage their feet. Using only the muscles in your thumbs can
    cause them to cramp up and get tired easily.\r\n\r\nStep 2 Massage the arches
    of the foot.\n\r\r\nMassage the arches of the foot. Use your thumbs to apply
    light pressure to the arch of their foot, right below the ball of their foot.
    Move one thumb clockwise and the other thumb counterclockwise in small circles.
    Do this for at least 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n    Place your thumbs on opposite ends
    of their foot and move them toward one another. Do this at least three to five
    times, moving up and down the bottom of their feet.\r\n    Grip their feet with
    firm pressure as you massage them. Light, soft touches can be ticklish to most
    people and distract from the massage.\r\n    If the person has any sore spots
    on their feet, do not put too much pressure on them as this can irritate the
    area.\r\n\r\nStep 3 Rub the heels of the foot.\n\r\r\nRub the heels of the foot.
    Move your thumbs up and down their Achilles tendon, which runs from the heel
    and ankle up to the calf muscle. Rub the heel of their foot in circular motions
    using your thumbs.\r\n\r\n    You may need to lift their foot up with one hand
    so you can access their heel.\r\n    The skin on this area tends to be dry or
    hard, so you can apply massage oil or lotion to your hands to help reduce any
    friction.\r\n\r\nStep 4 Squeeze and pull each toe.\n\r\r\nSqueeze and pull each
    toe. Hold their foot with one hand, right under the arch. With your other hand,
    place your thumb on top of their big toe. Your index finger should be underneath
    their big toe. Rotate the toe slightly to one side and pull the toe from top
    to bottom. Go back to the top of the toe and squeeze it with your thumb and pointer
    finger. Do this for each toe to help loosen and relax them.\r\n\r\n    Do not
    yank on the person\u2019s toes, as this can injure them. Instead, simply rotate,
    pull, and squeeze each toe slightly, applying even pressure.\r\n\r\nStep 5 Slide
    up and down each toe with your fingers.\n\r\r\nSlide up and down each toe with
    your fingers. Hold the foot with one hand, right behind the heel. Place the index
    finger of your other hand between the person\u2019s toes. Slide your finger toward
    the base of the toes and then back toward the end of the toes. Do this two to
    three times between their toes.\r\n\r\n    Make sure you use your body weight
    to apply even pressure as you slide up and down their toes.\r\n\r\nStep 6 Focus
    on one foot at a time.\n\r\r\nFocus on one foot at a time. Leave the other foot
    soaking in warm water or relaxed on the pillow. Do a basic massage on one foot
    first and then turn your attention to the other foot. Repeat the same movements
    for each foot so that they both feel equally relaxed. "
