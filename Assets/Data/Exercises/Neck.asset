    position. What's important is that their back can be comfortably straight. You
    must also be able to access their shoulders and upper back.\r\nUse a stool that
    gives you full access to their back.\r\nIf you use a chair, make sure the back
    of the chair is low enough to give you access to the back of their shoulders.\r\nIf
    you don't have an appropriate chair or stool available, place a comfortable cushion
    on the ground. Have your partner sit cross-legged on the ground while you kneel
    behind them.\n\r\nStep 2 Use light, long strokes.\r\n\r\r\nUse light, long strokes.
    When we think of massages, most of us immediately think of the Swedish massage.
    It uses long, gentle motions along the surface of the muscles instead of the
    intense pressure of a style like the deep tissue massage.\r\nWhen you find tension
    knots, you can apply focused pressure.\r\nFor the most part, though, keep the
    pressure firm but not intense.\n\r\nStep 3 Warm the muscles up.\n\r\r\nWarm the
    muscles up. Rushing into intense massaging before warming up the muscles can
    cause your partner to tense up even more under your touch. Ease into the massage
    by using your fingertips to loosen up and prepare the neck and shoulders. This
    will put them in the frame of mind to relax into the experience.\r\nPlace the
    ring, middle, and index fingertips of your hands where the base of your partner's
    head meets the neck. Apply light but firm pressure.\r\nIf that feels uncomfortable,
    use whichever fingertips feel right to you. You might use just index and middle
    fingers.\r\nSlide your fingers down the sides of their neck, sweeping over onto
    the shoulders.\r\nMake sure to apply even pressure throughout, running your fingers
    over the muscles.\n\r\nStep 4 Knead your thumbs into the tense muscles.\r\n\r\nKnead
    your thumbs into the tense muscles. In the previous step, you may have felt hard
    knots in the muscles. These knots indicate tension, and they need focused pressure
    from your thumbs.\r\nPlace your thumbs on the tension knot.\r\nPlace your other
    four fingers on each hand on the front of your partner's shoulder to stabilize
    your thumbs when you apply pressure.\r\nApply firm pressure with your thumbs
    in a kneading, circular motion to release the tension in the muscles.\r\nDo this
    throughout the shoulder muscles, but especially on tension knots.\r"
