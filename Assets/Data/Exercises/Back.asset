  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "How do I give a back massage?\r\n\r\nYou can use lotion,
    cocoa butter, oil, or lanolin for a massage.\r\n\r\n    Put a small amount of
    warm lotion or oil on your hands. Rub your hands together so the lotion is spread
    evenly on your hands.\r\n    Move your hands slowly during the massage to help
    the person relax.\r\n    Start massaging the back at the lower back. Move your
    hands upward on both sides of the spine all the way to the shoulders.\r\n   
    Make a circular motion as you move your hands upward. Press a bit more firmly
    with your thumbs as you make the circles.\r\n    Move across the shoulders and
    start moving down the upper arms. Use less pressure as you move downward.\r\n   
    Ask if you are applying too much or too little pressure as you massage. Ask the
    person to tell you if he feels pain in any area. Do not massage a painful area,
    or massage it very gently.\r\n    Apply more lotion on your hands as needed.\r"
