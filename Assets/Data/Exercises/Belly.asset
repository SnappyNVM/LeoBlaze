  <Name>k__BackingField: Twisting crunches
  <TimeInMinutes>k__BackingField: 20
  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "Start laying on your back on a mat or a towel. Bring
    your hands up by your ears and take your elbows out wide. Then elevate your feet
    off the floor with a 90 degree bend at your hips and your knees. You want your
    thighs to be vertical and your shins to be parallel to the floor. This is the
    start position.\r\n\r\nThen, keeping your lower back pressed down into the floor,
    tuck your chin to your chest, draw your belly button down and contract your abdominals
    to roll your upper spine up off the floor. At the same time, using your obliques,
    twist your upper body to the left so that your right shoulder and elbow rotate
    across towards your left knee. From here lower yourself back to the floor by
    rolling your spine back down to the floor, and return your right shoulder to
    the floor and right elbow back out to the wide starting position. Repeat the
    same crunch and twist motion, this time bringing the left shoulder and elbow
    across to the right knee and lower back down to centre. This is one complete
    repetition. Keep your legs elevated and repeat the twisting crunches for the
    duration of the exercise, always finish on the opposite side to the side you
    started on.\r\n\r\nWatch out for the temptation to let your feet lower towards
    the floor, or for your knees to get drawn in towards the chest, allowing your
    hip-flexors to take over in the movement, which we don\u2019t want.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to dial the intensity down a little, try resting your feet up on a chair,
    step or bench."
