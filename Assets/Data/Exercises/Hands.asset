  <MediaText>k__BackingField: "Step 1\r\nRemember to breathe. As you do all these
    techniques, breathe in through your nose while expanding your diaphragm (belly-breathing),
    and out through the mouth. Breathing is as important as the massage itself, and
    it may be wise to take ten of these deep breaths prior to and after the massage.\n\r\nStep
    2 Use your thumb to do most of the work.\r\n\r\nUse your thumb to do most of
    the work. Start by holding out one of your hands, keeping your fingers straight.
    Then, wrap your opposite hand's fingers around the back of your hand with your
    fingers facing straight up. Your thumb should be laying on your palm, and pointing
    towards you\n\r\nStep 3 Move your thumb along the edges of your palm.\r\n\nMove
    your thumb along the edges of your palm. This technique is most effective at
    massaging the pads of your palms just under your fingers and thumb, and the entire
    edge of your hand. Compress your palm with your thumb, using short, caterpillar-like
    movements, going up and down, and working your way from the inside to the outside
    of your palm.\r\n\r\n    Apply the amount of pressure you are comfortable with.
    Start off using light pressure, and then work your way towards a deeper massage.\r\n   
    This will help you find tender, sore, or tight spots.\r\n\r\nStep 4 Locate the
    bones in the hand.\r\n\r\nLocate the bones in the hand. They will be long, like
    a continuation of the fingers through the palm. Pinch the base of the hand, in
    between the bones, and glide upwards. Continue using short strokes when rubbing.\n\r\nStep
    5 Include your fingers.\r\n\r\nInclude your fingers. When you reach the finger,
    continue to pinch up the finger with a firm pressure. Inch your thumb up and
    down each finger, starting at the balls, and working your way up slowly to the
    tip of your finger.\r\n\r\n    Squeeze along the sides of your fingers, too.
    Repeat this for every finger.\r"
